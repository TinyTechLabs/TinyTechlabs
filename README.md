# Tiny Tech Labs (TTLS)

Welcome to **Tiny Tech Labs** (TTLS)! This repository is a catch-all for every PowerShell script I've created over the years, as well as the ones I'm currently working on. 

## About Tiny Tech Labs

Tiny Tech Labs started in 2014 as a fun domain name for my personal lab, and it has since grown into a fully-fledged business, **Tiny Tech Labs LLC**. I am currently a Senior Engineer at an IT consulting company, and this repository reflects my ongoing passion for technology and coding.

## What You’ll Find Here

This repository features a wide variety of scripts and code samples, primarily written in **PowerShell**. These scripts focus on:

- **Microsoft Technologies**: Including Windows Server, M365, Azure, and more.
- **Occasional Explorations**: Some scripts dabble into Linux and other open-source technologies, reflecting my occasional ventures outside the Microsoft ecosystem.

## About Me

I'm a Senior Engineer with a strong focus on Microsoft technologies. I primarily code with **PowerShell**, which I find to be a powerful tool for automating tasks and managing environments. While my work revolves around Microsoft products, I also explore and experiment with other technologies whenever I get the chance.
